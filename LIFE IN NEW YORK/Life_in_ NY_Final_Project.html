 &nbsp;&nbsp; I came to <a href="https://www.nycgo.com/"> New York City</a> 9 years ago, being here was not easy since then.
 Many things are happened in my life that made me growing up in many different ways. I have met interesting people, other not so much but the point is that I've learned from them how I would like to be in the future as well as I have seen myself in some of those good and bad people. In 2012 I decided to run again, after long time without do exercises is difficult start over again running. Running in Prospect Park in Brooklyn made me decided to join one of the biggest running club of the city, <a href="https://pptc.org/"> Prospect Park Track Club </a>. I met interesting people that make think in take the next step in my life going to College.
